### Who is using this framework

A collection is here: [Who is using it](https://github.com/opentf/html4scientists/wiki#wiki-who-is-using-this-templateframework)


### How to use

This template is designed to have the following features:

1. All pages load same css and js files in head tag, unless other pointed out specifically.
2. CSS/JS that is only used in that page is loaded in body tag unless it's not working.
3. All pages have the same footer which is configured in config/footer.json file.
4. Publication list can be automatically generated from config/publications.bib file by default or from an inline bib code (check template/publication/publication.html for example)


#### General web pages

Use the template.html in template folder to create your own page general page template. Then copy the menu and footer code into every other pages.


Things to change

* Favicon (You can keep mime if you want. The defaul is a Omega + Lambda, which indicates one of the most interesting topic in physics.)
* All the codes with []
* Check the links
* Sync the menu and footer codes between pages
* Google Analytics tracking code just before the closing of body tag. Should add your own in everypage unless you don't want to track.


Refer to [HTML Kickstart](http://www.99lime.com/elements/) for more instructions about the built-in elements.




#### Publication list


Publication list is one of the most useful features in this template. You can find the following two files in template/publication folder.

1. publication.html
2. publication-fromfile.html

The first one is the template for rendering inhtml bib contents. Add your bib contents in the html where we marked explicitly with ascii art.

publication-fromfile.html is a template for loading your publications.bib file with js and generate a publication table just like the other one. The good thing about using a different publications.bib file for your records is that you do not need to modify the html to add more publications. However, the draw backs of this is that the publication list can't be shown in a browser without js support (which is really rare these days).
